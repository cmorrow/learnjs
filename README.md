# Learn Javascript

## Purpose
This is a public repo for learning purposes. All code is 100% free to anyone.

Related videos for all code samples are on YouTube at: [https://www.youtube.com/c/youwebdev](https://www.youtube.com/c/youwebdev). Let me know if there are any suggestions or questions you have. I'm always glad to help anyone learning Javascript.

## How to Use
Each project folder contains a "video-link.txt" file which contains the link to the YouTube video link related to that code.

Some projects include a "final" folder. On these projects begin the lesson with the files outside of the "final" folder. If you encounter problems, you can compare your code with the code inside the "final" folder to help discover any bugs un your code.

PS: If you find any bugs in the code provided, please provide a comment on YouTube. Thanks and happy coding!
